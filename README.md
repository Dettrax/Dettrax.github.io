## Projects

### [Prudential Dataset](https://github.com/Dettrax/PrudentialDataset)
Led a risk assessment optimization project for Prudential Life Insurance, developing a machine learning algorithm to assign risk factors using minimal customer data. Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and boosting algorithms on a 2015 dataset, achieving top Kaggle performance with 23% fewer features, while maintaining significant variance retention.

### [Malaria Topic Modelling Project in R](https://github.com/Dettrax/malaria-articles-analysis)
Developed and implemented a data processing pipeline to systematically extract, clean, and organize data from a vast collection of malaria-related articles. Utilized clustering and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify main themes and significant keywords, revealing prevalent research areas and enhancing insights into the malaria landscape.

### [Multimodal Forecasting Model for Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/Dettrax/multimodal-forecasting-model-for-stock-price-prediction)
Developed an advanced oil price prediction system combining ARIMA and GARCH models for price and volatility Time Series forecasting, respectively. Achieved a 17% performance enhancement over traditional attention mechanisms by integrating the novel MAMBA model. Optimized system performance with LSTM models via Optuna, incorporating XGBoost and leveraging historical data and news sentiments for improved predictive accuracy.

## Professional Experience

### Research Assistant | NJIT | Newark, NJ
**May 2024 - Present**
- Enhanced the TransformerG2G model, integrating selective state-space MAMBA models to achieve superior generalization across benchmark datasets for temporal graphs, resulting in a 37% performance improvement.
- Conducted advanced research on Alzheimer's disease prediction using Wulver's High-Performance Computing system, applying deep learning models and selective state-space analysis to fMRI data, aiming to improve early detection capabilities.
- Working on development of a hierarchical encoder for JAMBA models, focusing on embedding in hyperbolic spaces to revolutionize the handling and analysis of complex network data, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of data representation in LLM applications.

### Associate Data Engineer | Accenture | Mumbai, IN
**July 2021 – April 2023**
- Spearheaded the migration of 9 critical microservices to AWS cloud infrastructure for a major insurance client, enhancing API request handling capacity from 3,000 to 20,000 records per day, significantly improving system scalability and operational efficiency.
- Designed and implemented a robust PySpark data processing pipeline on AWS State Machine, managing the daily processing of over 20,000 records. Established RDS databases for efficient handling of liability data during migrations, ensuring data integrity and seamless operations.
- Modernized legacy Java code by transitioning RESTful API projects to Python, optimizing them to meet AWS Lambda’s 15-minute execution window. Developed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, enhancing the speed and reliability of microservice deployments.
- Led the development and deployment of Python packages, utilizing CI/CD pipelines for systematic management on JFrog. Implemented Datadog dashboards to monitor cloud resource utilization, resulting in improved error detection and handling through monitoring of Lambda, Redshift, State Machine, S3, Glue Jobs, SNS, and SQS.
- Mentored junior engineers and conducted training sessions on cloud technologies and best practices, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the team.
